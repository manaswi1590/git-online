Hello! This repository contains the projects I’ve been building while actively learning through MLH (Major League Hacking) video sessions. The topics I’ve explored so far include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While following along with the tutorials, I didn’t just stop at replicating what was shown instead, I applied my own creativity and extended the functionality and design. Each project reflects both what I’ve learned from MLH and how I’ve chosen to build on that knowledge by experimenting and personalizing the designs. This README and the code itself highlights my hands-on learning journey and growing confidence as a developer.
